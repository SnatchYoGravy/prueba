        Lucki Camel Jr. (born May 30, 1996), known mononymously as LUCKI, is an American rapper and record producer from Chicago, Illinois. Regarded as an influential figure in underground hip-hop, he initially came to public attention in 2013 after releasing his debut mixtape, Alternative Trap. He followed with a number of projects, including his sixth mixtape Freewave 3 (2019); he later followed with the EPs Days B4 III (2019) and Almost There (2020) after signing to record label Empire.

        Lucki Camel Jr. was born on May 30, 1996, in the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. He listened to Erykah Badu, Prince, and The Notorious B.I.G. growing up[4] and cites Chief Keef, Future, Kanye West and Babyface Ray as some of his current inspirations.[5] Lucki started rapping in his first year of high school after praise from his close friends. Soon after, he dropped out of Proviso East High School at the age of 16 to pursue music full-time because the pressures of high school fame went against his will to study.
